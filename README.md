# Shield_Insurance_Analysis
Focus on understanding the number of customers we have and the total revenue we are generating. It would also be beneficial to track the daily revenue growth rate and daily customer growth rate to monitor our progress.

Monitoring changes in policies on a month-over-month basis is also important to identify trends and areas for improvement. It would be helpful to segment our customer base by age group and analyze revenue and customer numbers by city and age group.

To analyze trends in customer and revenue growth over time, it would be great to create a switch between revenue trend graphs and customer trend graphs. Additionally, using filters to analyze sales mode, age group, city, month, and policy ID would make the analysis more efficient.

It would be valuable to have a separate page for sales mode analysis to better understand our customer demographics. We can calculate total customers and total revenue split percentages by sales mode, and analyze the trend of sales mode over the month.

Having a separate page for age group analysis would also be helpful to understand the impact of age groups on our business. We can analyze age group data to understand expected settlement, sales mode, and policy preference, which will help us make informed business decisions.
